# ghtop
> See what's happening on GitHub in real time (also helpful if you need to use up your API quota as quickly as possible).

`ghtop` provides a number of views of all current public activity from all users across the entire GitHub platform. (Note that GitHub delays all events by five minutes.)

## Install

`pip install ghtop`.

## How to use

Run `ghtop -h` to view the help. There are 4 views you can choose: `ghtop simple`, `ghtop tail`, `ghtop quad`, or `ghtop users`. Each are shown and described below.

### ghtop simple

A simple dump to your console of all events as they happen.

### ghtop tail

Like `simple`, but removes most bots, and only includes releases, issues and PRs (open, close, and comment events). A summary of the frequency of push events is also shown at the bottom of the screen.

### ghtop quad

The same information as `tail`, but in a split window showing separately PRs, issues, pushes, and releases. This view does not remove bot activity.

### ghtop users

A summary of activity for the most active current users, including bots.
